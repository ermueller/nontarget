    dmzdens: 3.5		        # Maximum measurement deviation (+/-) of m/z within an EIC
    ppm: yes			          # Is dmzgap given in ppm ("yes") or as an absolute value ("no")?
    drtgap: 300			        # RT gap width for partitioning IN SECONDS
    drtsmall: 12		        # RT window of a peak IN SECONDS

    recurs: 8			          # Maximum number of peaks within one EIC
    SB: 2			              # Signal-to-base ratio
    SN: 5			              # Signal-to-noise ratio
    minint: 5.0e+04		      # Minimum intensity of a peak
    maxint: 1.0e+07	        # Peaks above maximum intensity are always retained, regardless of other checks

    ion_mode: auto		      # Polarity of the ionization of the files, can be "auto" (automated detection) "positive" or "negative". Auto-detection should only not viable for older .mzMLs and polarity switch files
    ion_mode_force: no      # Should the data be processed as the supplied ion mode polarity, regardless of what the files specify?

# apLCMS-Alignment parameters
Alignment:
    min.exp: 1			            # Minimal number of times one peak must occur to be listed in the alignment table (And further processed)
    mz.tol: 2.5e-06		          # RELATIVE m/z tolerance given as a ratio (1e-06 is one ppm)
    chr.tol: 6			            # Retention time tolerance IN SECONDS
    find.tol.max.d: 1e-04       # Consider only m/z diffs smaller than this value - only used if mz.tol is .na
    max.align.mz.diff: 0.001	  # Absolute mz difference tolerated, works in tandem with mz.tol

# Blank Correction parameters
Blank_Correction:
    quantile_t_test: 0.99	      # Quantile for the t-test of the blank correction. The EPA procedure used highly recommends 0.99, but can be changed for more or less lenient correction. ONLY CHANGE THIS IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING
    blank_class: "Blank"        # The classification name of blank files, which is either supplied manually or by placing the Blanks in a folder with the same name a "blank_class"

# Componetization (isotope, adduct search) parameters
Componentization:
    isotopes: yes               # Should isotopes be annotated?
    adducts: yes                # Should adducts be annotated?

# Gap filling parameters
Gap_Filling:
    alphabet_size: 4
    word_length: 7
    matrix_multiplier: 7        # A multiplier for the distance scoring of SAX-sequences; functionally similar to the 


# Target Annotation parameters
Target_Annotation:
    Target_Annotation: no
    substance_table: "Substances.csv"   # Path or name of the substance file (default: "Substances.csv")
    rtwindow: 12                # Total retention time tolerance IN SECONDS (setting can be overridden by substance specific value in the substance_table)    

# Post-processing parameters
Post_Processing:
    threshold: 0.9              # Threshold for "Peak removal safety", 1 means only very safe blank/isotope/adduct peaks will be removed
    heatmap: no                 # Draw heatmap of the aligned and procssed peaks? TAKES VERY LONG

# Quantification parameters
Quantification:
    Quantification: no
    method: "target"            # The quantification method; Either "EIC" to calculate intensities by looking at the EIC-range or "target" to utilize the target annotation results
    calib_class: "Calibration"  # Which classname does a sample need to have to be used as a basis for the Quantification?
    quant_class: "Sample"       # Which classname does a sample need to have to be quantified?
    calibration_table_file: NA
    quant_test: FALSE
    min_calib_points: 4         # The minimum of calibration points required for the calibration modeling
    low_level_plot: FALSE       # Should teh lower calibration part should be plotted or not
    low_plot_scale_factor: 0.05 # Enter the scale factor for plotting the low level calibration range; It allows a better visual inspection of the low calibration range fits, typical values are 0.1 or 0.05
